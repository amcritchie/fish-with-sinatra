<h1>Atlantic Halibut</h1>
<h2><i>Hippoglossus hippoglossus,</i></h2>
<h2>Salt Water</h2>
<p>The Atlantic halibut, is a flatfish of the family Pleuronectidae. They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between 50 and 2,000 m (160 and 6,560 ft). The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world. Halibut are strong swimmers and are able to migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.
